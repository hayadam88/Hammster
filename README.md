# What is Hammster?

Hi there! Thanks for checking out Hammster. This is an app I developed for my solo project while attending Prime Digital Academy. My friends and I used to always joke about how much we enjoyed Hamm's beer. Over the years this evolved into a genuine love for the product. Whenever one of us would find a bar that had Hamm's on tap we would text the rest of the people in our friend group and let them know. This was always exciting because it was such a rare occurence. For whatever reason, Hamm's is not a popular tap beer. When I was trying to decide what to do for my solo project, I thought that a fun idea could be an app that keeps track of all known Twin Cities' bars that have Hamm's on tap. In addition to that, if someone found a new bar they'd be able to add it to the app. So that is how Hammster, an app that tracks local bars with Hamm's on tap, was born.
